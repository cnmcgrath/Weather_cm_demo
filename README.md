# Weather_cm_demo
The fucking weather app

Hey everyone! This is the souce for the iOS dev talk I gave at ACM on 2/5/15

First note:
  The app won't build to a device unless you have an Apple Developer license ($100/yr) 
  Also, if you build on a simulator the API request and the Core Location part will fail
    The API part, I've added a link to the python script I'm using to scrape the webiste
    The Core Location part, you can manually set a location with iOS simulator and then 
    you can do cool things like change the location to San Fransisco or something...
    
  Python script:
